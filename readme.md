# EduTrack - Image Based Attendance Management System

## Project Overview

EduTrack is a smart attendance system built for schools, colleges, and universities. It uses Image Based recognition to take attendance automatically, so thereâ€™s no need for roll calls or manual tracking.

With personalized dashboards for students, teachers, and administrators, everyone gets the tools they need, right at their fingertips.

By cutting out the paperwork and streamlining the process, EduTrack saves time, reduces errors, and makes managing attendance simple, fast, and accurate.




## Key Features

- **Image Based Face Recognition**: Automated attendance tracking using facial recognition technology.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate interfaces for administrators, faculty, and students.
- **Secure Authentication**: Hardcoded credentials in MongoDB Atlas without registration route.
- **Cloud-Based Storage**: Data persistence using MongoDB & MongoDB Atlas.
- **Interactive Dashboards**:
  - Admin Dashboard for system management.
  - Faculty Dashboard for managing attendance records.
  - Student Dashboard for viewing attendance history and schedules.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Dockerized setup for easy installation and scalability.
## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **AI Components**: MTCNN and FaceNet Model for facial recognition
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)


## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized setup)

### Backend Setup

- Navigate to the backend directory:

        cd backend

- Create a `.env` file based on `.env.sample` with the following content:

    ```env
        DB_URI='MongoDB URI'

        PORT="Port"

        JWT_SECRET="Your Key"

        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="Cloud Name"
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="Cloud API Key"
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="API Secret"
        FACE_RECOGNITION_API_URL="http://0.0.0.0:8000"

        SPREADSHEET_ID = "SpreadSheet ID"
    ```

-  Install dependencies :

            npm install

-  Start the Backend Server:

            npm run dev

- Check out the [Backend API Documentation](./backend/readme.md) for more details.

### Frontend Setup

-  Navigate to the frontend directory:

           cd frontend

- Create a `.env` file based on `.env.sample` with the following content:

    ```env
        # Spreadsheet ID
        VITE_SPREADSHEET_ID="SpreadSheet Id"

        # Base URL
        VITE_API_BASE_URL="Backend URI"
    ```

-  Install dependencies :

            npm install
-  Start the development server:

         npm run dev

-  Access the application at http://localhost:5173

- Check out the [Frontend API Documentation](./frontend/README.md) for more details.

## Face Recognition Model Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
- Required Python libraries: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `mtcnn`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`

### Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the Face Recognition Directory**:

        cd face

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

        python -m venv venv

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - On Windows:

            venv\Scripts\activate

   - On macOS/Linux:

            source venv/bin/activate

4. **Install Required Dependencies**:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Run the Face Recognition API**:

        uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

6. **Verify the API**:

   Access the API at `http://0.0.0.0:8000` to ensure it is running correctly.

### Notes

- Ensure the `FACE_RECOGNITION_API_URL` in your `.env` file matches the API URL (`http://0.0.0.0:8000`).
- The `requirements.txt` file should include all necessary dependencies for the face recognition model.

## Docker Setup

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed ([Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
- Docker Compose (included with Docker Desktop)


## Setup Docker Files 

- Create a .env file in the project root with your environment variables

        DB_URI="DB URI"

        PORT="Backend Port"

        JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>

        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloud_name>
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>

        FACE_RECOGNITION_API_URL=http://0.0.0.0:8000

        SPREADSHEET_ID=<your_spreadsheet_id>

- Build and Run with Docker Compose

        docker-compose up --build


## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

EduTrack implements a secure role-based access control system with the following user roles:

### Admin

- Full access to all system features
- User management capabilities
- Analytics and reporting

###  Faculty

- Manage course attendance
- View student attendance records
- Generate attendance reports
- Mark attendance

###  Student

- View personal attendance records
- Check schedules and timetables
- Receive notifications for attendance status

Note: User credentials are pre-defined in MongoDB Atlas. There is no registration route.
